# Welcome {-}

This bookdown on discrete Hidden Markov Models & their applications to statistical genetics is my capstone! I made this for my Mathematical Statistics course taught by [Kelsey Grinde](http://kegrinde.github.io). Big thanks to her for her guidance and help.

Content was written and gathered by [Freddy Barragan](https://freddybarragan.netlify.app) with appropriate citations for print materials. Wherever possible, I try to provide direct link citations for any digital materials or resources.

**Note:** This is a very brief primer & I assume minimal mathematical background.
