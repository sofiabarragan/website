I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/). Broadly, my research aims to integrate rigorous Bayesian statistical methods with anti-racist theoretic frameworks to study the health of nonwhite, transgender, and HIV+ populations in the United States. I received a BA in Statistics from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in May 2022.

Currently, I am researching and developing machine learning (ML) techniques that maximize model fairness and minimize differential misclassification by race in suicide risk prediction models under [Dr. Yates Coley](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/r-coley) and in collaboration with the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Instituteâ€™s Biostatistics Division. 

While at Macalester, I had the pleasure of working with the University of Minnesota's fabulous Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research on multiple projects concerning the epidemiology of pediatric cancer. Broadly, I worked on the application of admixture mapping, gene expression analysis, and survival modeling to study racial and sex-based disparities in pediatric cancer incidence and outcome.

Outside of research, I love making digital art, drinking monster, making spotify playlists, and reading critical theory. My greatest passion, however, is being silly and having fun :)
